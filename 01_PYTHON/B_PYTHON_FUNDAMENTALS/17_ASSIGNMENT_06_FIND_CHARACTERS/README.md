# Assignment: Find Characters

~~Write a program that takes a list of strings and a string containing a single character, and prints a new list of all the strings containing that character.~~

Here's an example:

```python
# input
word_list = ['hello','world','my','name','is','Anna']
char = 'o'
# output
new_list = ['hello','world']
```
Hint: how many loops will you need to complete this task?

    one loop for each string.  N at best, linear time minus non strings would be the best value, but still linear time.
